# TODO

The DNS plugin is in progress! Many core features have been implemented and tested. See [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md) for completed work.



### Phase 22: Testing & Quality Assurance

- [ ] **Test Coverage Enhancement**

    - [ ] Malformed DNS records and zone names
    - [ ] Network timeouts and connection failures
    - [ ] API rate limiting and quota exhaustion scenarios
    - [ ] Large-scale operations (100+ domains per app)
  - [ ] Enhance error condition testing:
    - [ ] DNS provider service outages and degradation
    - [ ] Partial API failures and inconsistent responses
    - [ ] Concurrent operation conflicts and race conditions
    - [ ] File system permission and storage issues
    - [ ] Memory and resource exhaustion scenarios

    - [ ] Implement rate limiting and timeout simulation capabilities
    - [ ] Add zone delegation and cross-provider routing simulation
    - [ ] Create mock provider state persistence for multi-step tests
  - [ ] Test provider failure and recovery scenarios using mock provider:
    - [ ] Single provider failure with mock provider fallback simulation
    - [ ] Partial provider functionality degradation using mock error modes
    - [ ] Network partition simulation using mock provider timeouts
    - [ ] Provider credential expiration testing with mock authentication failures

- [ ] **Security & Reliability Testing**
  - [ ] Test installation on fresh systems:
    - [ ] Ubuntu 20.04 LTS and 22.04 LTS installation testing
    - [ ] CentOS 7 and Rocky Linux 8 installation verification
    - [ ] Debian 10 and 11 compatibility testing
